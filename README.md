## Highlights & Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for the practicals for the  EEE4120F: High Performance Embedded Systems course, a honours level module in Electrical Engineering at the University of Cape Town (UCT).

## Repository Structure
The repository is organised as follows:
- Each practical has its own dedicated folder (e.g., `Practical 1`, `Practical 2`, etc.)
- Within each practical's folder, you will find:
  - The practical manual.
  - The practical tutorial
  - The practical skeleton's code.

## Practicals Overview
Each practical is geared to run concurrently with what is taught in class
