## Prac 1: Octave
An introduction to benchmarking, the golden measure, speed-up and report writing.

## Prac 2: OpenCL
Investigate how heterogenous computing can effect measured wall clock time, and when and where heterogenous computing is worth it or not due to transfer overheads.

## Prac 3: MPI
Learn about distributed memory programming models by applying filters to images.

## Prac 4: FPGA Wall clock
An introduction to reconfigurable hardware. Students create a wall clock on a Nexys board (Nexys 4 DDR or Nexys A7 suggested).
